# day 1 notes

### Declartive

Don't describe what should be manipulated, describe what you want the end state to be.

App should be a 'function of state', as state changes, the app 'reacts'.

A app would be a 'function of state & time' if its configured in one way which cannot change and react to state (to a degree). Meaning that the app is locked into a certain shape based on something that was previously true.

If a component just has side effects, you can just render null and only rely on the component to manage those side effects.

### Unix Philosophy

* Do one thing and do it well (small sharp tools).
* Have a shared interface.

### Hooks

React Today and Tommorrow and 90% Cleaner React with Hooks

### Linters

eslint-config-react-app + prettier

### Composed Components
