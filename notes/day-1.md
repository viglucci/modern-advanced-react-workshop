### Declartive

Don't describe what should be manipulated, describe what you want the end state to be.

App should be a 'function of state', as state changes, the app 'reacts'.

If a component just has side effects, you can just render null and only rely on the component to manage those side effects.

### Unix Philosophy

* Do one thing and do it well (small sharp tools).
* Have a shared interface.
